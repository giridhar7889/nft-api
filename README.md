# NFT-API

This api is developed using django rest framework to retrive information from world's largest NFT marketplace.

## Description

In addition to an instant marketplace for NFT assets, OpenSea provides an HTTP API for fetching non-fungible token ERC721 and ERC1155 assets based on a set of query parameters. Monitoring every non-fungible token contract and caching metadata for each individual token can be a lot of overhead for wallets and websites that wish to display all of a user's collectibles, gaming items, and other assets. By aggregating this data in an easy-to-consume API, we make it easy for wallets and other sites to jumpstart their projects and to make the community as a whole more connected.
